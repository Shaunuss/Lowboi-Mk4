PARTS DESCRIPTION:
The drivetrain on this uses a single piece gear hob and bearing idler configuration, resulting in a very smooth and high extrusion quality, practically eliminating the common woodgrain artifacting seen in numerous other extruders. This is down to the gear hob being one piece and fully concentric, and no gear meshing issues sometimes seen in dual drive gear extruders.

GEAR:
K1 steel drive gear hob with DLC coating is sourced from AliExpress, originally intended as an upgrade part for the Creality K1 extruder. Gear and bearing quality may vary depending on vendor, so I recommend the use of high quality NSK bearings including replacing the stock bearing that comes with the gear.

WORM:
Worm is a high quality steel worm from KHK which can come in one or two start configuration, cut down to 12mm long. You are looking at the two start version of the Lowboi Mk4 with a 15:1 drive ratio. I have also made an extruder body for the one start version for 30:1 drive ratio.

GREASE:
It is recommended to use grease containing molybdenum disulphide for lubricating the worm and gear, for it's increased anti wear properties.

IDLER BEARING:
Idler is a small bearing mounted in the latch on a GCR15 bearing steel shaft. It is technically a fixed unfixed idler without spring, with only a tiny amount of flex in the tensioning latch itself. This provides very strong grip on the filament by the hob.

MOTOR:
Lowboi Mk4 uses a NEMA14 36mm pancake motor with 5mm D shaft configuration.

With the LDO-36STH20-1004AH-RevA-1 motor that has 0.1Nm of torque, this extruder has been tested to flow up to 31mm^3/s through a Trianglelab Dragon Ace hotend with the stock 0.4mm nozzle.
On a Chube conduction hotend this has been shown to flow over 60mm^3/s.

The BOM specifies a MOONs motor which has 0.23Nm of torque for considerably more extrusion pressure, and can be sourced from Formbot's website. Either motors are viable options.

BUILD TIPS:
I have printed this in Polycarbonate, and ASA. Both have worked well.

Print orientation is standing in the normal upright position, on the foot flange, 0.2 layer height with 100% infill, and using automatic supports.

After printing and removing supports, run a 2mm drill bit down through the filament tunnel all the way through the extruder to clear any burrs and prep the tunnel.

Carefully wind a 4mm drill bit by hand through the drive shaft bores, taking care to keep the bit aligned with the holes to avoid removing excess material.

Do the same with a 3mm drill bit through the pivot point bore on the latch. You shouldn't need to do it for the bearing bores unless the shaft is a stubborn fit.

Assemble as per the exploded view, you may need to use polygrip pliers to fit the 4mm driveshaft through the body and bearings.

Don't forget to cut the worm down to 12mm, and mount it spaced 0.1mm off the face of the motor.

Please enjoy Lowboi Mk4 and I would be grateful for your feedback!
